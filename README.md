My name is Taweh Beysolow. I have a BS in Economics and an MS in Applied Statistics. I am currently a Data Scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton in the Washignton DC area, and my goal is to obtain a PhD in Statistics so I can focus on developing machine learning algorithms to be used in applications as well as for business making decisions. My interests primarily are in Algorithm development, Quantitative Finance, Machine Learning, and any intersections of these subjects. All code on this page is available for anyone to use and learn from.

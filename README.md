My name is Taweh Beysolow. I have a BS in Economics and an MS in Applied Statistics. I am currently working in Quant Research and Quant Risk at a hedge fund, and my intention is to eventually obtain a PhD in Statistics so I can focus on developing machine learning algorithms in an enterprise setting. My interests primarily are in Data Science, Quantitative Finance, Machine Learning, and any intersections of these subjects. This code is available for anyone to use and learn from.
